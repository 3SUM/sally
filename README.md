# Sally

Actually online, unlike sally.cs.unlv.edu

If you have questions or concerns please feel free to contact me here or on **Discord @icantcode#5581**.

## Installation & Usage

To use Sally you will need `Python 3.8`+ and the [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
library beforehand. If you do not have the library installed please use the following command:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

If you are not familiar with `Python` virutal environments, I recommend reading this [article](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

```
TBD
```
